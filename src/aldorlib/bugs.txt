* Inlining of symbols in extendedEuclidean in Integer

* ALDORROOT-autoconfig/unicl interaction [PROBABLY DONE]

* Scobinding of:
  default Str, Sym, Int, Flt, Expr: SetCategory
  SExpressionOf(Str, Sym, Int, Flt, Expr): Decl == Body where
    default a: XXX
    Decl ==> SExpressionCategory(Str, Sym, Int, Flt, Expr)
    Body ==> add
  default should be allowed in the "Where" clause  

* Inlining (or not) of IdealElt

* 0.. in error messages appears as ..(0)

* 'for (free a, local b) in foo()' should be supported.
  Syntax does not support it at the moment, which is unfortunate

* Enumerations should support 'case'

* See 'x/PFE.as'.  Basically '%' in categories isn't bound
  to the 'right' thing.
